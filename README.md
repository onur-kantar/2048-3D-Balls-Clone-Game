# 2048-3D-Balls-Clone-Game
This is the work I did in **2 days** to create a clone of **2048 3D Balls** game. I tried to create some basic mechanics used in the game.

## Mechanics

* Drop the ball by swiping
* Bounce
* Merge with balls of the same number
* Increasing the score every time you get 2048
* End the game if it exceeds the limit

## Gameplay
