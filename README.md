# 2048-3D-Balls-Clone-Game
This is the work I did in **2 days** to create a clone of **2048 3D Balls** game. I tried to create some basic mechanics used in the game. Made with **[Unity](https://unity.com/)**.

## Mechanics

* Drop the ball by swiping
* Bounce
* Merge with balls of the same number
* Increasing the score every time you get 2048
* End the game if it exceeds the limit

## Gameplay
Merge balls with the same number. You earn scores every time you create 2048. If you go over the limit, you lose the game.
